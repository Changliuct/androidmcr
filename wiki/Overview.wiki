#summary Overview of the tasks we need to get done

= The Basic Plan =

  1.  Basic GUI
  2.  Figure out how to use OpenMCR and separate out the parts of the application we need
  3.  Server-side implementation of OpenMCR to test the GUI
  4.  Get a basic phone port set up; handle dependency issues
  5.  Test the phone port and look for potential points of optimization
  6.  Add usability features: e.g., save/e-mail the recording

= Optional, depending on results and progress =
  * Look into doing feature recognition on the phone & other half on server
  * Compare beat of playing music to beat of MIDI

= Current Progress =
  * Adrienne currently working on basic GUI
  * Cynthia starting on the basic phone port of OpenMCR & dependency issues
  * Vera reading about how neural networks work
